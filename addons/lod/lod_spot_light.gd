# The rate at which LODs will be updated (in seconds). Lower values are more reactive
# but use more CPU, which is especially noticeable with large amounts of LOD-enabled nodes.
# Set this accordingly depending on your camera movement speed.
# The default value should suit most projects already.
# Note: Slow cameras don't need to have LOD-enabled objects update their status often.
# This can overridden by setting the project setting `lod/refresh_rate`.

# Positive values will decrease the detail level and improve performance.
# Negative values will improve visual appearance at the cost of performance.
# This can overridden by setting the project setting `lod/bias`.
